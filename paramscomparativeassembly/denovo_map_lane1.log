Raw haplotypes will be written to './populations.haplotypes.tsv'
Population-level summary statistics will be written to './populations.sumstats.tsv'
Population-level haplotype summary statistics will be written to './populations.hapstats.tsv'

Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)
More details in './populations.log.distribs'.

Removed 0 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 175011 loci.
Kept 175011 loci, composed of 20847983 sites; 0 of those sites were filtered, 79926 variant sites remained.
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 119.12bp (stderr 0.02).
